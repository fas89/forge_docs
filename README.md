# Fluid Forge Docs

Documentation for the [Fluid Forge CLI](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge-cli).

Fluid Forge is a contract-first CLI for building, validating, and deploying data products across local and cloud targets. The docs in this repo track the promoted CLI surface from `fluid --help`, with local-first onboarding and compatibility notes for older commands where needed.

## Start Here

- [Live docs](https://agentics-rising.github.io/forge_docs/)
- [Getting started](https://agentics-rising.github.io/forge_docs/getting-started/)
- [CLI reference](https://agentics-rising.github.io/forge_docs/cli/)
- [Providers](https://agentics-rising.github.io/forge_docs/providers/)
- [Forge CLI repo](https://github.com/Agentics-Rising/forge-cli)

## Current Versioning

- Current CLI release documented here: `0.7.9`
- Current scaffolded contract schema examples: `fluidVersion: 0.7.2`

Those are different on purpose. `fluid version` reports the installed CLI release, while `fluidVersion` inside a contract selects the contract schema version.

## First-Run Path

```bash
pip install fluid-forge
fluid version
fluid doctor
fluid init my-project --quickstart
cd my-project
fluid validate contract.fluid.yaml
fluid plan contract.fluid.yaml
fluid apply contract.fluid.yaml --yes
```

Optional AI-assisted scaffolding uses `fluid forge`:

```bash
fluid forge
fluid forge --domain finance
fluid forge --llm-provider openai --llm-model gpt-4o-mini
```

## Promoted Command Groups

| Group | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Core Workflow | `init`, `forge`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply` |
| Generate | `generate transformation`, `generate schedule`, `generate ci`, `generate standard` |
| Integrations | `publish`, `market`, `import` |
| Quality & Governance | `policy-check`, `diff`, `test`, `verify` |
| Utilities | `config`, `split`, `bundle`, `auth`, `doctor`, `providers`, `version` |

Compatibility commands such as `generate-airflow` are still documented, but the docs now lead with the promoted paths above.
