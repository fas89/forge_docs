# MCP Server

`fluid mcp serve` exposes the staged forge pipeline as a stdio MCP server for clients such as Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, and VS Code MCP integrations. It is a foreground process: no daemon, no HTTP port, and no background service. The server is built on the official MCP Python SDK (`FastMCP`) and speaks MCP protocol version `2025-06-18`.

## Start the server

```bash
fluid mcp serve
```

For read-only inspection:

```bash
fluid mcp serve --read-only
```

For scoped write access:

```bash
fluid mcp serve \
  --readable-paths ./forge-output \
  --writable-paths ./forge-output \
  --writable-namespaces history,audit
```

## Access controls

Every `tools/call` is checked by policy before it executes.

| Control | Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only mode | `--read-only` | Rejects every mutating tool |
| Read scope | `--readable-paths PATH[,PATH...]` | Path-based read tools may only inspect files below these roots |
| Tool allowlist | `--allow-tools TOOL[,TOOL...]` | Hides and blocks tools outside the allowlist |
| Tool blocklist | `--deny-tools TOOL[,TOOL...]` | Blocks named tools; denial wins over allow |
| Filesystem scope | `--writable-paths PATH[,PATH...]` | Mutating tools may only write below these roots |
| Store scope | `--writable-namespaces NS[,NS...]` | Mutating tools may only write listed store namespaces |

The default readable and writable path is the current working directory. The default writable namespaces are `history,audit`.

## Tools

| Tool | Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_logical_model` | read | Load a `.model.json` sidecar and return the typed logical model |
| `validate_contract` | read | Validate a Fluid contract or forged model sidecar |
| `diff_models` | read | Compare two logical model sidecars |
| `search_semantic_memory` | read | Search the semantic memory namespace for similar prior models |
| `update_entity` | write | Rename or update one logical model entity |
| `add_relationship` | write | Add a relationship to a logical sidecar |
| `regenerate_physical` | write | Regenerate the contract and physical fanout from a logical sidecar |
| `list_source_adapters` | read | List available source-catalog adapters |
| `list_source_tables` | read | Enumerate tables from a configured source catalog |
| `inspect_source_table` | read | Inspect a source table profile and metadata |
| `list_source_lineage` | read | Read lineage from a configured source catalog |
| `list_source_glossary` | read | Read glossary terms from a configured source catalog |
| `forge_from_source` | write | Forge a contract and `.model.json` sidecar from a configured source catalog |
| `forge_run` | write | Run a full `fluid forge` in-process — `mode` is `blank`, `diag`, or `ai` |

Every advertised tool includes an MCP `inputSchema`, so clients can provide typed autocomplete and validate arguments before dispatch.

## LLM sampling

The `forge_run` tool's `diag` and `ai` modes need a language model. Rather than configuring a second API key for the server, Forge uses **MCP sampling**: the server sends the model request back through the MCP connection to the client (Claude Code, Cursor, …), and the client fulfils it with the LLM the user already pays for.

So an agentic IDE can run an AI-assisted forge end-to-end on its own subscription — there is no separate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the MCP server. Pair this with [`fluid scaffold-ide`](../cli/scaffold-ide.md), which writes the MCP server entry straight into the editor's config.

## Claude Code example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fluid-forge": {
      "command": "fluid",
      "args": [
        "mcp",
        "serve",
        "--read-only"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FLUID_QUIET": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remove `--read-only` and add both `--readable-paths` and `--writable-paths` when you want the client to patch model sidecars or regenerate artifacts inside a specific workspace directory.

## Cursor example

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "fluid-forge": {
      "command": "fluid",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {
        "FLUID_QUIET": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`FLUID_QUIET=1` is important because stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC frames.

## Credential handling

The MCP wire format does not accept inline catalog credentials. Source-catalog tools resolve credentials from saved Fluid source configs, environment variables, or explicit credential IDs that were configured outside the MCP call.

Set up a source first:

```bash
fluid ai setup --source snowflake --name snowflake-prod
```

Then an MCP client can call `forge_from_source` with `source: "snowflake"` and `credentials.credential_id: "snowflake-prod"` without receiving raw secrets.

## Certification

Before publishing a release, run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/mcp_client_certify.py
```

The certification script checks the JSON-RPC lifecycle, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, MCP Inspector when available, and Claude Code config health when the `claude` CLI is installed. Optional client checks are skipped when their tools are not installed; protocol failures fail the script.
