features:
  - title: Local First
    details: Install the CLI, scaffold a project, validate it, and run it locally before you touch cloud credentials.
  - title: Contract-Driven
    details: Use one FLUID contract to describe the data product, then plan, test, verify, and publish from the same source of truth.
  - title: Promoted CLI Surface
    details: These docs track the current `fluid --help` experience so new users are not sent down stale or deprecated command paths.
  - title: AI-Optional
    details: Start with `fluid init` for a quickstart or use `fluid forge` when you want AI-assisted scaffolding and discovery.
  - title: Multi-Target Delivery
    details: Build locally with DuckDB, then target GCP, AWS, Snowflake, or standards/export flows when you are ready.
  - title: Compatibility Aware
    details: Legacy commands still exist in the docs where they matter, but primary pages lead with the current recommended workflow.

> **Fluid Forge is for data engineers who want to write a data product contract once and deploy it anywhere.** Build and test locally with DuckDB, then push the same contract to BigQuery, Athena, or Snowflake — no pipeline glue code to maintain.

## See it run

A 60-second walkthrough of `fluid forge data-model from-intent` against four LLM providers (Anthropic Haiku 4.5, OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini, Gemini 2.5-flash, local Ollama gemma4) — every token count is from a real production call.

Use ←/→ to step scenes, space to pause, r to restart.

## Start with the current workflow

```bash
pip install data-product-forge
fluid version
fluid doctor
fluid init my-project --quickstart
cd my-project
fluid validate contract.fluid.yaml
fluid plan contract.fluid.yaml
fluid apply contract.fluid.yaml --yes
```

This docs site currently tracks:

- CLI release `0.8.0`
- Scaffolded contract examples using `fluidVersion: 0.7.2`

`fluid version` and `fluidVersion` are different things. The first is the CLI release you installed. The second is the schema version inside a contract.

## Optional AI-assisted scaffolding

```bash
fluid forge
fluid forge --domain retail
fluid forge --llm-provider openai --llm-model gpt-4.1-mini
```

Use `fluid forge` when you want discovery, memory, and LLM-guided scaffolding. Use `fluid init` when you want the fastest deterministic quickstart.

For model-first work, forge from a business intent file and then generate dbt:

```bash
fluid forge data-model from-intent --example retail > intent.yaml
fluid forge data-model from-intent intent.yaml -o customer_orders.fluid.yaml
fluid generate transformation customer_orders.fluid.yaml -o ./dbt_customer_orders --dbt-validate
```

For every AI and data-model journey, including hosted provider strict mode, Ollama, DDL, source catalogs, review/diff/learn, and scheduling, see [AI Forge And Data-Model Journeys](/forge_docs/walkthrough/ai-forge-data-model.html).

## Where to go next

- [Getting Started](/forge_docs/getting-started/) for the local-first path
- [Forge Data Model](/forge_docs/forge-data-model.html) for intent, DDL, and catalog-driven model generation
- [AI Forge And Data-Model Journeys](/forge_docs/walkthrough/ai-forge-data-model.html) for end-to-end AI-assisted and deterministic flows
- [CLI Reference](/forge_docs/cli/) for the promoted command surface
- [Providers](/forge_docs/providers/) for platform-specific guidance
- [Walkthroughs](/forge_docs/walkthrough/local) for end-to-end examples

Compatibility note:
`fluid generate-airflow` is still available, but primary docs now lead with `fluid generate schedule --scheduler airflow`.
