# Getting Started

Run your first data product locally in a few minutes, then move to cloud targets when you are ready.

## What you skip with Fluid Forge

You're about to ship a working data product in 30 seconds. The four-tool stack you'd otherwise need: **gone**.

- **No Airflow DAG to write or maintain.** `fluid generate schedule --scheduler airflow|dagster|prefect` emits the right artifact.
- **No JVM, no cluster, no heap tuning.** `engine: duckdb` runs embedded.
- **No Snowflake permission sprawl.** `accessPolicy.grants` compiles to native `GRANT` statements.
- **No Terraform for data IAM.** `policy-apply` emits BigQuery / Snowflake / S3 IAM bindings from the same contract.
- **No 27 questions before you ship.** `fluid forge` infers from your local files; you answer 4.

## What this guide assumes

- Python `3.10+`
- `pip`
- No cloud credentials required for the local-first path

## Install the CLI

The current docs baseline is `0.8.3` — the stable tag was cut on `2026-05-25`. The PyPI publish lands shortly after the tag, so depending on timing you may see either `0.8.3` or the functionally-equivalent `0.8.3rc1` candidate as the latest stable on PyPI:

```bash
# Once 0.8.3 stable is on PyPI:
pip install --upgrade data-product-forge
pip install "data-product-forge==0.8.3"     # exact pin

# While the PyPI publish is in flight, opt in to the matching candidate:
pip install --pre data-product-forge        # resolves to 0.8.3rc1
```

Pre-releases ship to PyPI as PEP 440 pre-releases — `pip install` skips them by default. The `--pre` flag opts in.

### Dependency floor (what you'll see in `pip install`)

`0.8.3` pins minimum versions on several deps to close known CVEs:

- `jinja2 >= 3.1.6` (CVE-2025-27516), `h11 >= 0.16` (CVE-2025-43859), `cryptography >= 46.0.7` (CVE-2026-26007 / 39892 / 34073)
- `litellm >= 1.83.7, < 2` (CVE-2026-42208) — **skips the compromised `1.82.7` / `1.82.8` PyPI artifacts**
- `mcp >= 1.20` (required for `fluid mcp serve` sampling), `keyring >= 24.0` (now a hard dependency — catalog source secrets default to the OS keyring)

Check the installed CLI and basic system health:

```bash
fluid version
fluid doctor
```

This docs set tracks CLI release `0.8.3`. Docs updates land in lockstep with each release; if you're on an older CLI, some `--mode` / `--target` flags mentioned here won't be present yet — see the [CLI index](../cli/README.md) for what maps to what.

> **Extending the CLI?** `0.8.3` ships three plugin extension points and a companion SDK on PyPI. If your team has its own CI templates, scaffolding standards, or governance rules, see **[SDK & Plugins](../sdk-and-plugins/)**.

## Understand the version numbers

You will see two different version concepts in the docs:

- `fluid version` reports the installed CLI release, such as `0.8.3`
- `fluidVersion` inside `contract.fluid.yaml` selects the contract schema version, such as `0.7.3`

Which `fluidVersion` a fresh scaffold emits depends on the path:

- `fluid init --quickstart` copies the `customer-360` template verbatim, which is pinned at `fluidVersion: 0.7.2`.
- `fluid init --discover`, `fluid forge`, and `fluid product-new` go through the factory and emit `fluidVersion: 0.7.3` — the latest bundled schema.

The CLI still accepts contracts with `fluidVersion` `0.4.0`, `0.5.7`, `0.7.1`, `0.7.2`, and `0.7.3` — run `fluid version` for the authoritative compatibility list.

## Quickstart with `fluid init`

Create a local project:

```bash
fluid init my-project --quickstart
cd my-project
```

Then run the core workflow:

```bash
fluid validate contract.fluid.yaml
fluid plan contract.fluid.yaml
fluid apply contract.fluid.yaml --yes
```

::: tip 🎉 You just shipped a data product
That output at `output/customer_360.parquet` is real. It has a schema, a contract, a validated SQL transformation, declared owners, and a deployment record. **You shipped a versioned data product on your laptop in under a minute.**

**Three things you can do right now:**

1. **Switch clouds with one line** — change `binding.platform: local` to `binding.platform: gcp` in `contract.fluid.yaml`, run `fluid apply` again. Same data product, on BigQuery. ([GCP walkthrough](/forge_docs/walkthrough/gcp))
2. **Add an AI policy in 5 lines** — append an `agentPolicy` block (`allowedModels`, `deniedUseCases`, `auditRequired`). Now `fluid policy-check` enforces who can read this from an LLM. ([Agent policy guide](/forge_docs/concepts/agent-policy))
3. **Tweet your win** — [share this on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20shipped%20a%20data%20product%20in%2030%20seconds%20with%20Fluid%20Forge%20%F0%9F%9A%80&url=https%3A//agenticstiger.github.io/forge_docs/&hashtags=dataproducts,DataOps) — paste the `fluid apply` output if you want to flex 😉

## Beyond dev — the 11-stage production pipeline

The commands above are the dev on-ramp. For production, `0.8.3` promotes an 11-stage pipeline with cryptographic plan-binding, explicit destruction gating, and supply-chain signing:

```
1. bundle → 2. validate → 3. generate-artifacts → 4. validate-artifacts
      → 5. diff (drift gate) → 6. plan → 7. apply → 8. policy-apply
      → 9. verify → 10. publish → 11. schedule-sync (Path A only)
```

See the [11-stage pipeline walkthrough](../walkthrough/11-stage-pipeline.md) for the full end-to-end flow and [`fluid generate ci`](../cli/generate.md) for auto-generating a parameterised pipeline for Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab / Azure DevOps / Bitbucket / CircleCI / Tekton.

## What the quickstart gives you

The generated project includes a working contract plus local assets so you can validate and apply immediately. The exact scaffold evolves over time, but the important files are:

```text
my-project/
├── README.md
├── contract.fluid.yaml
├── data/
└── .fluid/
```

## Optional AI-assisted path with `fluid forge`

If you want the CLI to discover local context and scaffold with LLM help, use `fluid forge` instead of `fluid init`:

```bash
fluid forge
fluid forge --domain finance
fluid forge --llm-provider openai --llm-model gpt-4.1-mini
```

Use `fluid init` for the fastest deterministic quickstart. Use `fluid forge` when you want discovery, memory, or domain-guided scaffolding.

## Promoted next commands

```bash
fluid test contract.fluid.yaml
fluid verify contract.fluid.yaml
fluid generate schedule --scheduler airflow
fluid publish contract.fluid.yaml
```

Compatibility note:
`fluid generate-airflow` still exists, but the promoted orchestration path is `fluid generate schedule --scheduler airflow`.

## Move to providers later

When you are ready to target a provider:

- [GCP guide](/forge_docs/providers/gcp)
- [AWS guide](/forge_docs/providers/aws)
- [Snowflake quickstart](/forge_docs/getting-started/snowflake)
- [Provider overview](/forge_docs/providers/)

## Troubleshooting

### `fluid: command not found`

Try the module entry point:

```bash
python -m fluid_build.cli --help
```

### Local quickstart dependencies look incomplete

Run:

```bash
fluid doctor --verbose
```

### Unsure what to use next

Use the CLI help pages:

```bash
fluid --help
fluid <command> -h
```
